# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

Created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that displays options for the user to enter their guess of Rock, Paper, or Scissors to beat the computer/A.I in a match to see how gets five points first. This Project revolves around implementing the skills and knowledge I learned and applied from The Odin Project curriculum.

Any advice on how to improve it is greatly appreciated! Always looking to learn and improve my web developments skills.

Huge thank you to The Odin Project for putting these lessons together and giving us the opportunity to study, practice, and implement all the skills and lessons we learned with this projects!

Here is a preview on how the website looks as well as how it works:

When the user chooses an option to find against the computer, we display the result of that round:
