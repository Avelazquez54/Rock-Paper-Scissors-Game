# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

Created a console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that prompts the user to enter they guess to beat the computer/A.I in a best of our five. This Project revolves around implementing the skills and knowledge I learned and applied from The Odin Project curriculum. 

Plenty of debugging and testing used to make sure the computer generated a different response every round as well as the user input works as well with regards to how the user decides to spell the words: Rock, paper, or scissors. 

Any advice on how to improve it is greatly appreciated! Always looking to learn and improve my web developments skills.

Huge thank you to The Odin Project for putting these lessons together and giving us the opportunity to study, practice, and implement all the skills and lessons we learned with this projects!

Below is a preview of what my project looks like as well as what responses to expect when playing:
